# FLTR MCP Positioning: Two-Sided Data Marketplace

**Core Insight:** FLTR is a two-sided marketplace where creators monetize datasets and consumers query them via natural language.

**MCP Role:** Universal interface for both creating and consuming data.

---

## 🎯 The Complete Value Proposition

### What FLTR Already Does (Two Sides)

**Creator Side:**
```
Data Creator → Upload Dataset → FLTR Processes → Earn Revenue
                                       ↓
                        (Vector embeddings, indexing)
                                       ↓
                             Ready for queries
```

**Consumer Side:**
```
Data Consumer → Query via FLTR → Get Results → Pay per Query
                                      ↓
                    (Vector search, semantic analysis)
                                      ↓
                           No downloads needed
```

**Key Point:** FLTR is a marketplace, not just a query service.

**Why This Matters:**

**For Creators:**
- ✅ Monetize existing datasets (passive income)
- ✅ No infrastructure costs (we handle hosting, embeddings)
- ✅ Reach AI-native audience (Claude users, developers)
- ✅ Revenue share: 70% creator, 30% FLTR

**For Consumers:**
- ✅ No need to set up local vector DB
- ✅ No need to manage embeddings
- ✅ No need to handle data updates
- ✅ Just query and get results
- ✅ Pay only for what you use

## 🚀 What MCP Adds (For Both Sides)

### For Creators

**With MCP Distribution:**
```
Creator → Upload Dataset → FLTR Marketplace → Consumers discover via MCP
                                                    ↓
                                          One-click install to Claude
                                                    ↓
                                            Queries start flowing
                                                    ↓
                                             Revenue earned
```

**The Unlock: AI-Native Distribution**

**Before (Traditional Marketplace):**

### For Consumers

**With MCP Access:**
```
Consumer → Claude Desktop → FLTR MCP → Discover & query datasets
                                              ↓
                            (Same vector search & analysis)
                                              ↓
                                 Results in Claude conversation
```

**The Unlock: Natural Language + Context**

### Tweet Thread

```
1/ We just launched MCP support for FLTR 🎉

Now you can query 100+ curated datasets directly from Claude Desktop.

SEC filings, legal docs, market research - all accessible via natural language.

2/ How it works:

You already have the datasets (on FLTR).
Install our MCP connector.
Query from Claude instead of our web UI.

Same data analysis, just in your conversation.

3/ Why this matters:

❌ Before: Search FLTR → Copy results → Paste in Claude
✅ After: Ask Claude → Auto-queries FLTR → Results in thread

No context switching. Chain queries. Build workflows.

4/ Example:

"Compare NVIDIA and AMD's AI revenue from their latest 10-Ks"

Claude:
- Queries SEC filings dataset (via FLTR)
- Finds relevant sections
- Synthesizes comparison
- All in one conversation

5/ Setup takes 2 minutes:

pip install fltr-mcp
Add API key to Claude config
Start querying

100 free queries to try it out.

6/ This is the future of data access:

Not downloads.
Not dashboards.
Just natural language queries.

Your datasets where you already work.
